# Sakai Neovim
***Sakai*** *(坂井)* is the name of my personal configuration for Neovim.
This is a light and functional configuration that converts Neovim to a full IDE with many easy-to-learn shortcuts.

This build is updated regularly.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/2ELCN0168/sakai-nvim
